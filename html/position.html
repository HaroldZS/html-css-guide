      <p>
        Sailing the Sunset Strip, I'm a bit of a king<br>
        Granny would take a trip, I've been bending the strings<br>
        Got hammers in both my hands, such a delicate touch<br>
        They say I'm from Amsterdam, does that make me Dutch?<br>
        Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh<br>
        Please don't remember me Lord and children<br>
        Please don't remember me, it's only 1980<br>
        It's only 1983<br><br>
    
        Smoking the reefer, feeling my own light<br>
        My brother's a keeper, I married a TV wife<br>
        The devil's Camaro, parked in the high school lot<br>
        A little sombrero 'cause teacher was way too hot<br>
        Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh<br>
        Please don't remember me Listen Lord now<br>
        Please don't remember me, it's only 1980<br>
        It's only 1983<br><br>
    
        Tell my love "But leave me never"<br>
        Can't complain about the weather<br>
        Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball<br>
        Cut my teeth down at the Whiskey<br>
        GTO's tried to kiss me<br>
        One more song, they have seen it all<br>
        Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh<br>
        Please don't remember me What'd I say Lord?<br>
        Please don't remember me, it's only 1980<br>
        It's only 1983<br><br>
    
        Please don't remember me for what I did with David<br>
        You know I'm talkin' David Lee<br>
        Am I ready?<br>
        Please don't remember me, for what I did last night, oh<br>
        I guess I played a flying V
